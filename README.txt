SAMPLE OUTPUT:

>>> euclid_gcd(252,198)
18
>>> extended_gcd(252,198)
18 36 18 36
36 54 36 54
54 198 54 198
198 252 198 252
252 198 252 198
(4, -5)
>>>

HOW TO COMPILE:

Step 1:
Open your python shell.

Step 2: Open the gcd.py file included in the attachments

Step 3: compile and run it for my shell (IDLE) it is just the F5 key to run it.

Step 4: type the example commands from the SAMPLE OUTPUT above.



the two functions are:
euclid_gcd(x,y)

extended_gcd(x,y)
